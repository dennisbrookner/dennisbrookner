My name is Dennis Brookner, and I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Doeke Hekstra's lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu/) in the Harvard Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. I'm interested in using the tools of X-ray crystallography to learn how protein structure and dynamics contribute to function. Our lab's work on the data-processing side of crystallography can be found as part of [Reciprocal Space Station](https://rs-station.github.io/)

In my free time, I'm a contributer to [Puntalytics](https://puntalytics.github.io), a twitter account devoted to using open-source football analytics tools ([`nflfastR`](https://github.com/mrcaseb/nflfastR) and formerly [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR)) to study punting in the NFL.
