My name is Dennis Brookner, and I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in [Doeke Hekstra's lab](https://hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu/) in the Harvard Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. I'm interested in using the tools of X-ray crystallography to learn how protein structure and dynamics contribute to function.
